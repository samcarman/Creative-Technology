
== Video Patching ==
Video patching occurs in two places inside the contorl room: soft/digital routing in the Black magic router, and physically - in the patch bays.

Patch bays are labelled:
* Rows: A, B, C, and D 
* Inputs in each row are numbered from left to right.

Hence the third input from the left in row A would be denoted "A3". A camble linking A3 to the 12th input in row B would be denoted "A3 ? B12"
