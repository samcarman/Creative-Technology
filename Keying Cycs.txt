How to key Prayer, Praise, Ways to Give and Altar Call CYCs

Traditionally, the Prayer, Praise, Ways to Give and Altar Call CYC have had a black background. However, we now key the CYC on the weekend’s preach CYC M2.

1.	During the MC Spot, the centre screen should be on M2/Preach CYC.

2.	Make sure the slides are up on PPT1/M3.

3.	Use when the MC calls for Prayer Requests, Praise, Ways to Give or Altar Call.

4.	Hit the Key 2 Auto (M3) or Key 3 Auto (PPT1) on Centre Transition 1 and the content will be keyed on M2.


PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU TEST THIS BEFORE THE SERVICE TO GET FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCEDURE!
