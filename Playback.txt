It is controlled by the PVS app on the Producer’s iPad. Videos can be tested using the Production Monitor (see ‘Playback Controls’ guide).
Make sure PVS is selected on PB1 or PB2 to ensure FOH receives the audio. (Ideally 1)

See ‘Playback Controls’ guide for how to use the system.
If required, click on the video inspector ? to modify the start and end point of the video. Please test the video after modification.
